"""Drives `speech worker` with a synthesis model through its protocol the way a caller does, with every line checked by
worker_client.py: one JSON object per line, and one terminal message per request and nothing after it.

It checks ready (the release, and the model information of `speech info --json` with the device, the
threads and the voices of --add-voice), info and count_tokens, also answered while a synthesis runs; that a seed repeats the audio and a drawn seed is
reported and repeats it too; cancels while a request waits, while it runs, of an unknown id, and after an end, whose id
a later request then reuses; a second request under an id in flight; each error with its code and option (members the
message does not have, values of the wrong type, out of range or not taken, a missing text, lines that are not JSON
objects or have no id or type, the other task's messages); chunks to a synthesis model; add_voice, and a recording
refused by a model that takes voice files alone; for
Irodori-TTS a fixed length, the progress of a long sampler, a paragraph past what one request speaks spoken in one
synthesize, whose reported seed repeats it, and a run with no place to cut refused, naming it, for Drama 3 max_seconds,
the sampling options' ranges and a paragraph of several of its chunks spoken in one synthesize, for Pocket TTS
max_seconds, a temperature of 0 that draws nothing and a paragraph of several of its chunks spoken in one synthesize,
with no text too long, and for Qwen3-TTS a
text past its tokens refused, max_seconds and the sampling options, and an instruction where the model takes one and its
refusal where it does not; and that a request option given to the worker as a flag is the default of a request that
does not set it, while one the model does not take or out of its range ends the worker with fatal. Writes the first
answer to a WAV.

usage: python3 checks/smoke/worker_smoke.py <out.wav> <speech> <model.gguf> [worker options...]
       A model that takes voice files needs --add-voice NAME=FILE, whose FILE add_voice adds again under another name.
