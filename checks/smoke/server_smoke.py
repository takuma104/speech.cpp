"""Drives `speech serve` over HTTP the way a client of OpenAI's audio API does, with the standard library alone.

It checks GET /health, GET /v1/models and /v1/models/{id} (OpenAI's model object with the release and the model
information of `speech info --json` with the device, the threads and the voices of --add-voice), a model it does not
serve, the endpoint of the other task, and CORS. For a synthesis model: a wav with its X-Sample-Rate, X-Speech-Seed and
X-Speech-Stop, a pcm stream and an SSE stream of the same seed giving the same samples, the SSE stream's
speech.audio.done with the seed, the samples and the stop reason, a drawn seed that repeats the audio, and each error
with its status, type, param and code: the server's own (a member it does not have, a value of the wrong type, no
input, a format it does not give, a body that is not JSON) and the library's mapped by category (a value it does not
take, out of range or not taken, an empty or too long input, a voice left out), on a wav and on a stream, Qwen3-TTS's
and Drama 3's sampling options, and OpenAI's instructions followed by a model that takes them and refused by one that
does not. For a
recognition model: json and text with X-Speech-Stop for each dump of reference/fastconformer/dump.py or
reference/qwen3-asr/dump.py, each other request a Qwen3-ASR dump holds with its language and its prompt as form fields
and each decoding other than the default that a FastConformer dump holds as the form field decoding, json without any
member but the text, verbose_json of each request with the language qwen-asr parsed by its tag or without one
(FastConformer, audio without speech), and where the model takes timestamps with its segments, the same with a segment
granularity, and that granularity's refusal where it does not; WAV at three times the model's rate, and the errors of a
file that is not WAV or cannot be read, a language, a prompt, a decoding, a member and a granularity it does not take,
and audio the library cannot take.

For a synthesis model, also that a request option given to the server as a flag (--seed, and --tts.seed for the
synthesis model alone) is the default of a request that does not set it, listed in /v1/models' defaults beside the
model information as it was, and that one no model given takes, or one for a task without a model, stops the server;
a text of one sentence, and on a model that reads a text in one request a text of two, spoken as the worker speaks it
in one request, the server stopped meanwhile so that the model is held once at a time; and on a model that speaks a text a sentence at a time (Irodori-TTS),
a paragraph of thirty sentences, past its tokens and four times its 30 s, as a pcm stream whose first bytes come before
a quarter of the whole has passed, the samples of the wav of the same seed, one request a sentence in the log, a client
that goes away stopping it before the rest is made, and with --asr a recognition model that hears it within
worker_client.MOST_CER; and a run with no place to cut, refused.

With --vad a detection model, which the server holds beside the model: /v1/models lists it after the model, and for a
recognition model chunking_strategy "auto" on the dumps' audio joined with silences gives the text, the languages and
the segments of `speech asr --vad` with its defaults, the members of server_vad give those of the flags they map to, a
file of silence gives an empty text, and each form of chunking_strategy it does not take is refused. Without --vad,
chunking_strategy is refused with a pointer to the detection model. A detection model alone is listed, and both
endpoints answer that the server holds no model of their task.

The texts are the dump's for weights in F32 or F16, and for a quantized file the ones `speech asr` gives for the same
samples. The audio goes as 16-bit samples, which move the near-silent input of reference/qwen3-asr/dump.py far enough to
change the text a forced language makes of it; leave that dump out.

A synthesis model refuses /v1/realtime, whose sessions checks/smoke/server_realtime_smoke.py checks.
